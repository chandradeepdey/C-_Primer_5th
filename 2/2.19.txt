pointers
a) pointers are objects themselves, they contain the address to other objects.
b) pointers can be left uninitialized.
c) pointers can be made to point to a different location.
d) since pointers are objects, we may take pointers to pointers and references to pointers.

references
a) references are just names, not objects. they are aliases to other objects.
b) references must always be initialized.
c) references cannot alias a different object post initialization.
d) references are not objects, hence their addresses may not be taken.
