a) char, wchar_t, char[2]. wchar_t[2]
   the former two are single characters. the latter two are arrays
   containing two characters ('a'/L'a' and the null character).
   the first and the third use narrow characters, each 1 byte long.
   the second and fourth use wide characters, these are typically longer.

b) int, unsigned int, long int, unsigned long int, int, int
   the first is a normal integer.
   the second one has the u suffix indicating unsigned int.
   the third one has the L suffix indicating long int.
   the fourth one has the uL suffix indicating unsigned long int.
   the fifth one starts with a 0, indicating an octal integer literal.
   the sixth one starts with 0x, indicating a hexadecimal integer literal.

c) double, float, long double
   the first one is a normal floating point literal.
   in the second one, the f suffix indicates float.
   in the third one, the L suffix indicates long double

d) int, unsigned int, double, double
   the first one is a normal integer literal
   in the second one, the u suffix indicates unsigned int.
   in the third one, the decimal point causes the literal to be a double
   in the fourth one, usage of scientific notation causes this
