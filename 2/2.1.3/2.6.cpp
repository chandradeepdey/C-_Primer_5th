// int month = 9, day = 7;
// this is legal, 9 and 7 are integer literals that are
// used to initialize the variables month and day.

// int month = 09, day = 07;
// this is illegal, the 0 in front of the integers indicate
// that they are octal integer literals. however, octal integers
// cannot contain the digit 9. if this error is fixed, the day = 07
// part is valid. it uses the octal number 7, which is equal to
// decimal 7, to initialize day.
