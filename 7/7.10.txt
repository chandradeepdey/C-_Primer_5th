read(cin, data1) is done first. this will return cin as an lvalue. this lvalue is used to execute read(cin, data2). this will also return cin as lvalue. this lvalue is used as the test expression in the if statement. if at any point cin hits eof or error, the next step will fail until it reaches the if test, which will fail as well. if an error or eof is not hit, data will be read into the two objects and the if test will pass.
