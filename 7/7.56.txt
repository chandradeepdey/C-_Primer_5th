static members are members of a class that are associated with the class rather than with individual objects of the class.
the main advantage of static data members is that pieces of information can be shared between all objects of the class type.
they differ from ordinary members in that their lifetime ends with the program, instead of at the end of scope of a class object. further, in the event that a static member is constexpr, it can be used wherever a similar constant expression can be used.
