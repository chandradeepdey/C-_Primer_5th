if the constructor was not marked explicit, we would be able to copy initialise a vector from integral types. this would also allow us to replace anywhere a vector is required with an int. but vectors and integers aren't the same thing at all. a vector is a container, with its own member functions and operators. it would make sense to not allow constructions like those to prevent bad code.

the single element constructor of string allows us to copy initialise strings from c style string literals. this also allows us to replace anywhere a string is required with a c style string literal. this makes sense because the two objects are similar in nature and would be used in similar functions for similar purposes.
