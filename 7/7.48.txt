string null_isbn("9-999-99999-9");
implicit - this would create an std::string from the string literal.
explicit - still works

Sales_data item1(null_isbn);
this would create a new Sales_data object with the bookNo member set to a copy of the string null_isbn.
explicit - still works because direct initialisation.

Sales_data item2("9-999-99999-9");
this would implicitly convert the string literal to an std::string. then use it to construct a Sales_data object with the bookNo member set to the string.
explicit - still same
