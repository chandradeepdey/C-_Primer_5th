a list is a sequential container that implements a doubly linked list. the elements of a list are accessed by starting from one end of the list and moving through the links one by one. it is possible to easily remove or add elements at any point in the list by changing the links. lists are a good idea when the elements are huge and insertion at any point is needed.
sets contain a sorted list of keys. we may check whether a given key exists in the set or not. sets might be a good idea if elements are needed without duplication.
