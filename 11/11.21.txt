call the insert member of word_count with the argument {word, 0} forming a pair to be inserted. regardless of whether insert succeeds, its first member is dereferenced to increment the size_t value associated with the string. if it succeeded, the size_t value is 0. incrementing it notes the first occurrence of the word. if it failed, the size_t value is nonzero. we note the new occurrence of the word that already exists in the map.
