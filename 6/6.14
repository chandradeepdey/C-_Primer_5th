when we need to modify the object, a reference should be used.
example
void reset(int &n) {
    n = 0;
}

when only access is needed, references should be used if the object is large. copies should be used for smaller
objects. this is because dereferencing smaller objects is likely going to have a higher overhead than just copying it.
int startsWith(char c, const std::vector<std::string> &vect) {
    int ret = 0;
    for(const auto &s : vect) {
        if(s.length() != 0 && s[0] == c)
            ++ret;
    }

    return ret;
}
