a) put in header. inline and constexpr functions may be defined multiple times in the program. the compiler needs the defintion, not just the declaration in order to expand the code. however, all the definitions of a given inline or constexpr must match exactly. As a result, inline and constexpr functions normally are defined in headers.
b) put in a source file. normal functions can be defined exactly once but declared multiple times. the compiler needs the address of the function, so the declaration is enough. putting the function in a source file lets us have it compiled separately from other functions and source files.
