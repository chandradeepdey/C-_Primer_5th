bool containsUcase(const std::string &s) {
    for (const auto &c : s) {
        if (std::isupper(c))
            return true;
    }
    return false;
}

void toLcase(std::string &s) {
    for (auto &c : s)
        std::tolower(c);
}

no they were not the same. changing the contents was required in the latter case. in the former only checking was required, so I used a const.
