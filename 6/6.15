s is a reference because s is large. otherwise copying it could have a huge overhead.
s is const because we do not need to modify s in the function, it is good practice to keep such variables const.

occurs is a reference because we need to modify it.
it is a plain reference because we need to modify it. if we made it const, it would be impossible to store the number
in it.

c is not a reference because it is small and copying it will likely have less overhead than dereferencing a char&.
further, we have no need to modify it.
