a) f(int, int) and f(double, double) are viable functions. for argument 1, f(double, double) is a better match since it doesn't involve converting double to int. for argument 2 f(int, int) is a better match since it doesn't involve converting int to doulbe. this call is ambiguous.
b) f(int) and f(double, double) are viable functions with the second one being viable because the second parameter of that function has a default argument. however, the second function would require a built-in conversion from int to double, making the second one a worse match. thus, f(int) is the best match in this case.
c) f(int, int) and f(double, double) are viable functions. for both argument 1 and argument 2, f(double, double) is a worse match because it would involve a conversion from int to double. f(int, int) is the best match.
d) f(int, int) and f(double, double) are viable functions. for both argument 1 and argument 2, f(int, int) is a worse match because it would involve a conversion from double to int. f(double, double) is the best match.
