pointers can be thought of as large integers. adding two pointers would be equivalent to adding two random large integers. the resulting integer could be the address of anything such as a variable, the code of an instruction, or it could be an address outside the boundary of the program. so the address the supposed pointer would point to would be meaningless, dangerous even. this is why adding pointers is dumb.
