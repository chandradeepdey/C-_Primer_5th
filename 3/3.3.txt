with the string input operator, leading whitespace is ignored until the first non whitespace character. input is taken until the first whitespace character appears. in this way, the string input operator never stores a whitespace character in the string.
with the getline function, string input is taken until the next newline character appears in the stream. all types of characters except the newline character itself is stored in the string. this includes whitespace characters.
