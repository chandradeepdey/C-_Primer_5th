(beg + end) / 2 is illegal. big and end are both of type std::vector<int>::iterator. two objects of this type cannot be added.

beg + (end - beg) / 2 is legal. end - beg produces a difference type, which is an integer type. end - beg / 2 is also an integer type. further, (end - beg) / 2 would be "less than" the size of the vector. so we can add it to beg to produce a valid iterator. std::vector<int>::iterator + integer is valid.
