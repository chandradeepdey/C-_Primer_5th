to call void calc(int)
1) Zero or one standard conversion sequence - double to int (numeric conversion)
2) Zero or one user defined conversion
3) Zero or one standard conversion sequence
viable. uses standard conversion sequence

to call void calc(LongDouble)
1) Zero or one standard conversion sequence
2) Zero or one user defined conversion - double to LongDouble using constructor
3) Zero or one standard conversion sequence
viable. uses converting constructor, which is an user-defined conversion sequence

standard conversion sequences are ranked higher than user-defined conversion sequences, so void calc(int) is chosen
