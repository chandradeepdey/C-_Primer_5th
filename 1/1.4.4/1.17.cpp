// If all the input values are equal, the else inside the while loop
// is never executed. On reaching end-of-file or on an input error,
// the print statement that is the third statement in the block of the
// outermost if statement is executed to print the number of times the input
// values occurred.

// If there are no duplicated values, the if inside the while loop
// is never executed. Each time the while loop body is entered, the else part
// is executed, printing the fact that the previous input occurred once. On
// reaching the end-of-file or on an input error, the print statement that is the
// the thirds statement in the block of the outermost if statement is executed to
// print the fact that the last input also occurred only once.
