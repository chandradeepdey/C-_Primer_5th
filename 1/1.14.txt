The for loop seemed more useful when a variable was initialized using a simple expression and then the loop run a certain number of times using that variable.

If the initialization is involved something like getting an input from the user, the while loop seemed more suitable.

The for loop has one advantage in that the loop expression part is harder to accidentally omit compared to the controlling expression in the body of a while loop.
