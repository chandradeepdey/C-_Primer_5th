this program tries to add an std::string and a character, then compare that
string against the character 's', trying to store its result in p1. the result
is then supposed to be used to produce one of two statements which have no
effect.
the comparison against the character 's' fails because comparison between an
std::string and a character is invalid.

possible fix
string s = "word";
string p1 = s + (s[s.size() - 1] == 's' ? "" : "s");
