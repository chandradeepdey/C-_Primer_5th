a) assuming p is a type to which a bool can be assigned. (the getPtr()indicates
that p might be a pointer in which case the assignment would be illegal.) here
the comparison (getPtr() != 0) is done first. the result of this comparison is
assigned to p. then the new value of p is used to test the if statement.
change - if ((p = getPtr) != 0)
b) here 1024 is assigned to i. then the new value of i is used to test the if
statement.
change - if (i == 1024)
