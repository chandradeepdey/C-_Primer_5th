it is not an acceptable trade-off since it negatively impacts our grades. indian professors are most often dummy-dums and don't know anything about programming beyond some shitty books by shitty authors. at our university, questions involving i, ++i, and i++ are quite common in both theoretical exams and viva-voice exams during practicals. trying to argue about undefined behaviour and, in case of C, sequence points actually damages our grades because it hurts the professor's ego. we are supposed to mug up the results produced by turbo c++ as some sort of universal fact.
