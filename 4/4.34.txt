a) if fval is 0, the test is false, otherwise true.
b) ival is converted to float. fval and the converted ival is then added. the result is converted to double and stored in dval.
c)   dval + ival * cval;
   = (dval + (ival * cval));
   cval is promoted to int. ival and cval are multiplied. the result of the multiplication is promoted to double. this result is added to dval.
