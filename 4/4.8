in the logical AND operator, the left operand is evaluated first. the right
operand is evaluated if, and only if the left operand is true.

in the logical OR operator, the left operand is evaluated first. the right
operand is evaluated if, and only if the left operand is false.

in the assignment operator, the order of evaluation of the operands is
unspecified. they may happen in any order the compiler sees fit.
