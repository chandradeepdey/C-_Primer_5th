a) 'a' is promoted to int, 3 is added to the converted 'a'. the result is
   converted to char and stored in cval.

b)   fval = ui - ival * 1.0;
   = (fval = (ui - (ival * 1.0)));
   ival is converted to double and multiplied by 1.0. ui is converted to double
   and the result of the multiplication is subtracted from it. this result is
   then converted to float and stored in fval.

c) ui is converted to float and multiplied by fval. the result is converted to
   double and stored in dval.

d) ival is converted to float and fval is added to it. the result is converted
   to double and dval is added to it. the result is converted(with truncation)
   to char and stored in cval. this can be undefined behaviour if cval is
   signed and if the result is big enough.
