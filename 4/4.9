checks if cp is a null pointer. if cp is a null pointer, the right operand
is never evaluated and the entire test condition returns false. since in this
case it is not the NULL pointer, we proceed to the right operand. in the right
operand a check is made to see if the first character of the string literal is
the null character. since it is not, the logical AND returns true and whatever
is inside the body of the if statement is evaluated next.
