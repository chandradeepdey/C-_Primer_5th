the increment happens before dereferencing. if the vector is empty or if we are at the last element, this will cause the nonexistent one past last element to be dereferenced. this is undefined behaviour.
if the vector is nonempty, we will skip the first element. if the vector has at least one negative element, we will print the first negative element.
