overflow is when an attempt is made to change the value of an integer variable to a value outside the range the integer type is capable of storing.

#include <limits>
int imax = std::numeric_limits<int>::max();
int imin = std::numeric_limits<int>::min();

in each case, the second statement causes overflow.
int a = imax; ++a;
int b = imin; --b;
int c = imax; c *= 2;
