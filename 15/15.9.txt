dissimilar when the expression is a glvalue which refers to an object whose most derived type is different from the static type of the glvalue

struct base {
    int a;
};
struct derived : public base {
    int b;
};
derived d;
base *pb = &d;
base *pb2 = static_cast<base *>(&d); // static type of the expression *(static_cast<base *>(&d)) is base, dynamic type is derived
base &rb = d;
(*pb).a = 5; // static type of the expression *pb is base, dynamic type is derived
rb.a = 40;   // static type of the expression rb is base, dynamic type is derived
