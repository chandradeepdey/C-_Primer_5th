default initialises an std::vector<std::string>
makes capacity of vector at least 1024 (actual value is implementation defined)
takes in strings from std::cin and pushes them to the back of svec. this will not require a reallocation for at least 1024 strings (depends on implementation defined value from before)
resizes the vector to 1.5 times. if this value is greater than the capacity of the vector, this will cause a reallocation. the extra strings are constructed using the default constructor.
